# How to run the code

I have provided scripts to execute the code. 

Internally both the scripts run the following commands 

`npm start --silent input_files/inputFile1.txt`

I expect your program to take the location to the text file as parameter. Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to the console. The text file will contain only commands in the format prescribed by the respective problem.

This main file, main.go should receive in the command line argument and parse the file passed in. Once the file is parsed and the application processes the commands, it should only print the output.
